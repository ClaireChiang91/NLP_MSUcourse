# NLP_MSUcourse
This year, I got a chance of learning NLP(Natural Language Processing) with an amazing group together. Therefore, this is to store my work and exercise after the study. 
Majorly, we follow the course from [Prof. Mohammad Ghassemi](https://ghassemi.xyz/) and the following resource:
(1)Couse: [A Hands-on Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/deskool/nlp-class)
(2)Book: [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
